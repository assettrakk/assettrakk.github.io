There is a way to automate the routine tasks of almost all business function. Automation can be valuable in freeing resources that can be better used on the thing most important to the success of any business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-move-it-infrastructure-to-the-cloud\"\u003e2.

You will need the key applications that allow you to provide services to your customers running on servers. You also need to store all your business data securely in one place.  Historical information needs to be archived in a secure location as well. All of this requires capital expenditure for daily operations, maintenance and upgrades. Also this computing power consumption also shows up in your electricity bill.\nThe advent of cloud computing you can host most of the required applications off site and reduce operating cost while benefiting from higher reliability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-switch-to-free-apps-and-tools\"\u003e3.

When satellites are used to detect signals the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used to differentiate from signals received by terrestrial coastal watch stations. A ship\u0026rsquo;s AIS signature includes the unique identification code, position, course and speed as well as destination and estimated time of arrival displayed on a screen. Vessel equipped with AIS are tracked by coastline base-stations networks and by satellite when out of the range of the terrestrial networks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not a vessel monitoring utility or fishing catch monitoring system and it is dependent on its operator for the proper entry of information and for it to be turned on. Most not all vessels have AIS including fishing boats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis tracking technology was designed to be used between ships at sea in addition to radar to call out presence to other ships to avoid collisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"regulations\"\u003eRegulations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe International Maritime Organization\u0026rsquo;s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires AIS to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with 300 or more gross tonnage (GT), and all passenger ships regardless of size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2010 most commercial vessels operating on the European Inland Waterways were required to fit an Inland waterway certified Class A unit, all EU fishing boats over 15m were to have a Class A by May 2014, and the US had a long-pending extension to their existing AIS fit rules which was expected to come into force during 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"range\"\u003eRange\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShipboard AIS transceivers have a horizontal range that is highly variable, but typically only up to about 74 kilometres (46 mi).

There is an obvious difference between the pictures seen on a TV receiving terrestrial analogue transmissions from local TV stations such as CBC TV n Barbados and the quality of pictures streamed online or available from cable TV.

A video encoder is the stage where the signal from the video source is converted to an Internet protocol (IP) signal that can be distributed over the Internet. Video cameras especially professional one output quality and often high resolution signals. As a result encoding a video signal directly from a video source routinely results in very high quality pictures.
