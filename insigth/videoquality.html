<h3 id="why-video-streams-have-higher-quality-than-a-broadcast-tv-station-feed">Why video streams have higher quality than a Broadcast TV station feed.</h3>

<p>We have become accustomed to seeing high quality video on most devices available today. There is an obvious difference between the pictures seen on a TV receiving terrestrial analogue transmissions from local TV stations such as CBC TV n Barbados and the quality of pictures streamed online or available from cable TV. Here we will outline the difference between TV station transmission of video and that available from streaming sources and cable TV.</p>

<h4 id="streaming-video">Streaming Video</h4>

<p>In many cases video streams are distributed online from sources that are connected directly to a video encoder that delvers the video directly to the end user.  A video encoder is the stage where the signal from the video source is converted to an Internet protocol (IP) signal that can be distributed over the Internet. Video cameras especially professional one output quality and often high resolution signals. As a result encoding a video signal directly from a video source routinely results in very high quality pictures. Streaming video has the following characteristics:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The video source connects directly to a video encoder that encapsulate the video into an I stream.</p></li>

<li><p>The video encoder is connected directly to a online distribution server.</p></li>

<li><p>Online viewers connect directly to the online distribution server to receive the stream.</p></li>

<li><p>Viewers receive the IP stream that contains the encoded high resolution video feed.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The encoding and distribution of the video signal results in very little degrading of the video quality because the video signal once converted into a I signal is not directly subject to much processing on the way to the end user because it is the containing IP signal that receive much of the processing on it way to the user.</p>

<h4 id="tv-station-video">TV Station Video</h4>

<p>Traditional TV stations in the Caribbean such as CBC TV8 Barbados operate using the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC) system for production and distribution of video signals. In the NTSC system the analogue signal produced at the camera is sent through a number of stages that each contribute some level of degrading of the signal quality on the way to the end user.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>TV station video sources such as those from a remote broadcast or outside broadcast are produced using high quality equipment.</p></li>

<li><p>This video source is sent to the station via a NTSC link that has an impact on quality.</p></li>

<li><p>This signal has to be synchronized with other NTSC sources in the TV station that also contribution a level of degrading of the signal.</p></li>

<li><p>The Studio output is sent by a link to the analogue NTSC transmitter (the distribution point).</p></li>

<li><p>Viewers receive the degraded analogue NTSC resolution feed from the transmitter.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was possible to view the signal produced at the camera side by side with the signal received form the transmitter an observer wuld easily see the difference in quality of the two signals.</p>

<h4 id="resolutions">RESOLUTIONS</h4>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Streaming - Streaming Video Resolution is usually 1280x720</p></li>

<li><p>Broadcast TV - Analogue NTSC Resolution is 440 x 486</p></li>
</ul>
