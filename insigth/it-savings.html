<h2 id="1-automate-wherever-possible">1. Automate wherever possible</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It is already known that automation can make a difference to overhead costs while increasing productivity of most of today&rsquo;s businesses.

<h2 id="2-move-it-infrastructure-to-the-cloud">2. Move IT infrastructure to the cloud</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether you are small office or a large government office the software you use to manage you business require servers someplace. You will need the key applications that allow you to provide services to your customers running on servers. You also need to store all your business data securely in one place.  Historical information needs to be archived in a secure location as well. All of this requires capital expenditure for daily operations, maintenance and upgrades. Also this computing power consumption also shows up in your electricity bill.
The advent of cloud computing you can host most of the required applications off site and reduce operating cost while benefiting from higher reliability.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3-switch-to-free-apps-and-tools">3. Switch to free apps and tools</h2>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="4-invest-in-green-technologies">4. Invest in green technologies</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Going green can reduce expenditure for any business by as much as 70% of annual costs with investments in CFL and LED lights. Many of the services delivered by computers can also be hosted on small low power consuming computers as well that cost much less from the traditional PC.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="5-switch-to-linux">5. Switch to Linux</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>You reduce cost by switching to Linux on your computers. Desktop applications on this operating system have a long way and are extremely reliable. Many of the devices that we use today are a flavor of Linux so it is not new to any f us. Linux application are reliable and run on most devices available today. Linux is largely a free OS that can run on a bare bones computer.</p>
