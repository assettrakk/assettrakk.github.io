<h3 id="radio-and-tv-stations-websites-are-useless">Radio and TV stations websites are useless.</h3>

<p>Most radio or TV stations websites in the Caribbean region are usually an attempt at on-line promotions of their programming.</p>

<p>These websites will usually provide limited information regarding on-air talent, news and on-air promotions. The news stories on these websites are mostly not updated so as a result you are being encouraged to go to the local news paper website for the most up-to-date local news. Generally not even the regular station audience spend long periods on the websites and advertisers do not take them seriously. This is supported by the increasing amount of local businesses that are placing ads on-line through Google and Facebook. The question is can local stations make any money from websites given the advertising trends in 2018 and beyond?</p>

<p>The following should be given attentions for improving traffic and sales to station websites:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="1-your-content-is-not-fresh">1.Your content is not fresh.</h4>

<p>A lack of fresh content will affect search engine racking and impact on the number of visitors to your site. Visitors will return if your site is relevant and this includes having the up-to-date content expected by users. Also if you are providing news on your website your direct competitor is the newspaper so you have to be better at providing fresh content.</p>

<h4 id="2-your-website-does-not-perform-well">2.Your website does not perform well.</h4>

<p>Visitors to your website have become accustomed to websites that load quickly and are attractive so they have developed high expectations for what they are willing to accept.</p>

<p>Your website must load quickly.</p>

<p>Visitors must be able to find what they want easily.</p>

<p>Visitors should be able to read the content on any device.</p>

<p>Your site must be attractive in the opinion of the visitor.</p>

<h4 id="3-you-re-not-promoting-your-site">3.You&rsquo;re not promoting your site.</h4>

<p>You should be hammering the benefits of your website and providing reasons for visitors to come to the site regularly. This includes running promotions that tease visitors to come and do things on the website.</p>

<h4 id="4-you-re-not-tracking-the-effectiveness-of-your-website">4.You&rsquo;re not tracking the effectiveness of your website.</h4>

<p>Over time if you are monitoring the results of changes on the website you to should become aware of what works and what does not work and be better able to target content that brings more traffic. There should be changes in content, visitor engagement and site promotions that provide traffic data that you can use to evaluate the effectiveness of the website. Such data collected should also be used to show advertisers the benefits of using your website.</p>

<h4 id="5-your-sales-people-are-not-trained-to-sell-the-website">5.Your sales people are not trained to sell the website.</h4>

<p>The persons in your sales team may have grown you listening to your on-air work and maybe motivated and knowledgeable about the on-air content and talent.</p>

<p>As a result they maybe more inclined to sell on-air advertising with more passion. It is critical that you show them the importance of the digital media services that you provide.</p>

<p>They should be able to sell to advertisers that there is more than just banner ads. You can provide opportunities for guest posts, giveaways, sponsored features, articles and videos for example. Such initiatives will capture the attention of visitors and drive them to make purchases that increase your customer revenues.</p>

<h4 id="6-you-have-too-many-links-away-from-your-website">6.You have too many links away from your website.</h4>

<p>You have to ask yourself if the links away from your site really add value to the website and the advertisers that use it.</p>

<h4 id="7-your-site-is-not-mobile-friendly">7.Your site is not mobile friendly.</h4>

<p>More people are using mobile devices to access content on-line therefore your website must load quickly and be attractive to your visitors on any device they choice to use.</p>

<h4 id="8-you-re-not-operating-your-website-as-another-channel">8.You&rsquo;re not operating your website as another channel.</h4>

<p>Ultimately having more website visitors and more advertisers depends on how involved the station management team is with this asset. The station website should be consider an integral part of the station revenue earning assets.</p>

<p>You have to ask yourself if you are investing the effort, time and resources into your website just as if it was another channel with a revenue stream to making it a success. You should regularly evaluate the website operations to determine if it is delivering the required targets.</p>
