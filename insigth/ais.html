<h2 id="what-is-marine-automatic-identification-system">What is Marine Automatic Identification System.</h2>

<p>Marine Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a system that transmits tracking information of ships and used by vessel tracking services(VTS). When satellites are used to detect signals the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used to differentiate from signals received by terrestrial coastal watch stations. A ship&rsquo;s AIS signature includes the unique identification code, position, course and speed as well as destination and estimated time of arrival displayed on a screen. Vessel equipped with AIS are tracked by coastline base-stations networks and by satellite when out of the range of the terrestrial networks.</p>

<p>It is not a vessel monitoring utility or fishing catch monitoring system and it is dependent on its operator for the proper entry of information and for it to be turned on. Most not all vessels have AIS including fishing boats.</p>

<p>This tracking technology was designed to be used between ships at sea in addition to radar to call out presence to other ships to avoid collisions.</p>

<h3 id="regulations">Regulations</h3>

<p>The International Maritime Organization&rsquo;s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires AIS to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with 300 or more gross tonnage (GT), and all passenger ships regardless of size.</p>

<p>In 2010 most commercial vessels operating on the European Inland Waterways were required to fit an Inland waterway certified Class A unit, all EU fishing boats over 15m were to have a Class A by May 2014, and the US had a long-pending extension to their existing AIS fit rules which was expected to come into force during 2013.</p>

<h3 id="range">Range</h3>

<p>Shipboard AIS transceivers have a horizontal range that is highly variable, but typically only up to about 74 kilometres (46 mi). They reach much further vertically – up to the 400 km orbit of the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

<p>National Authorities use AIS for a number of monitoring activities along their coast lines. Depending on the coast base watch stations vessels can be monitored up to a range of 100Km (60mi) and supplementary data from satellite networks fill in for signals further away.</p>

<p>AIS is used for monitoring and control:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.Fishing fleet</p>

<p>2.Maritime security</p>

<p>3.Aids to navigation</p>

<p>4.Search and rescue</p>

<p>5.Accident investigation</p>

<p>6.Ocean currents estimates</p>

<p>7.Infrastructure Protection</p>

<p>8.Fleet and cargo tracking</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="rf-transmission">RF Transmission</h3>

<p>AIS uses the globally allocated VHF Marine Band channels:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Channel A 161.975 MHz (87B)
Channel B 162.025 MHz (88B)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Most AIS transmissions are composed of bursts of several messages. In these cases, between messages, the AIS transmitter must change channel.
AIS messages are transmitted using GMSK modulation. The GMSK modulator BT-product used for transmission of data should be 0.4 maximum (highest nominal value).</p>

<p>The GMSK coded data should frequency modulate the VHF transmitter. The modulation index should be 0.5.</p>

<p>The transmission bit rate is 9600bit/s
Ordinary VHF receivers can receive AIS with the filtering disabled. However, the audio output from the radio would need to be then decoded. Several software defined radio (SDR) computer applications can decode the AIS signal.</p>
